 //Dad Joke Mini Challenge

 // Made a basic site that pulls from the dad joke api and displays the joke when the button is pressed;

// Gavin - Works Great no errors in the code gives me a new joke each time i press the button, maybe could have styled the background a little more but aside from that its great!
